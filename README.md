### How to Use Soothe 2

1. **Insert Soothe 2 on your track** in your DAW (like Ableton, FL Studio, Logic, etc.).
2. Play the track and **watch the interface light up** where it detects resonances.
3. Adjust the **Depth knob** to increase or decrease the amount of reduction.
4. Use the **Frequency bands** to focus on specific areas (e.g., high mids on vocals).
5. You can also adjust the **Sharpness** to control how narrowly the plugin targets frequencies.
6. If needed, tweak **attack/release** to make it more or less reactive.
